    <h1 id="title1"> Our Vision </h1>
    <h2 id="title2"> Main Idea </h2>
    <h3 id="title3"> Vision allows the user to receive a live feedback of his or her environment. With this data, it converts images to text and translates the text into Speech. Speech is then presented to the User and gives them an estimate about their surroundings, even if they can't see.</h3>
    <h2 id="title2"> Intention </h2>
    <h3 id="title3"> Provides a realistic representation of the users environment through Speech. It also helps people who are blind, as it allows for them to recognize parts of their surrondings </h3>
